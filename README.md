This project uses [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com), [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/), and [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/). 

## Setup development environment  

Getting up and running is as easy as 1, 2, 3.

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS _'v8.9.x LTS'_](https://nodejs.org/), [npm _'v5.5.x'_](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [Yarn _'latest-version'_](https://yarnpkg.com) installed. 

2. Install your dependencies

    ```
    cd path/to/using-feathers-apollo-graphql; yarn
    ```

3. Start your app

    ```
    yarn start
    ```


This project uses [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com), an open source web framework for building modern real-time applications. 
Feathers has a powerful command line interface. Please read thru [Feathers docs](https://docs.feathersjs.com/).  
Here are a few things it can do:  

```
$ npm install @feathersjs/cli -g             # Install Feathers CLI v3.x  

$ feathers generate service               # Generate a new Service
$ feathers generate hook                  # Generate a new Hook
$ feathers generate model                 # Generate a new Model
$ feathers help                           # Show all commands
```
